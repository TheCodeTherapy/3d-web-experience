      <h1>Create Multiplayer Games and 3D Web Experiences with Zero Complexity</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>The 3D Web Experience</strong> is a revolutionary platform that showcases a
        technology that makes it easy for anyone - even complete beginners - to build
        <strong>interactive, multiplayer 3D web experiences</strong>. Whether you're creating a
        game, a collaborative virtual space, or an interactive simulation, MML handles networking,
        synchronization, and all the 3D complexities for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can start building your own 3D web games, that run on any browser, on any device, any
        operating system, and any VR headset, with stunning graphics and real-time multiplayer
        capabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Why MML?</h2>
      <p>
        MML is built from the ground up to power real-time, networked 3D worlds with
        **out-of-the-box** features like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Networking:</strong> No need to set up servers or synchronize clients.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Race Conditions:</strong> No race conditions or manual synchronization. State
          consistency is handled automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Math:</strong> No need for advanced transformations, quaternions, or physics
          calculations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You Can Build</h2>
      <p>
        The 3D Web Experience, powered by MML, allows creators to build a variety of
        <strong>interactive virtual experiences</strong>, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiplayer games.</li>
        <li>Collaborative virtual spaces and social worlds.</li>
        <li>Training simulations and educational experiences.</li>
        <li>Web-based 3D Experiences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The 3D Web Experience with MML abstracts away the complexities of real-time 3D networking,
        allowing you to focus on creativity. With simple declarative logic, you can build **fully
        synchronized multiplayer worlds** without writing any networking code or worrying about
        latency and state conflicts. MML handles all the heavy lifting for you, so you can
        collaborate in real-time with others and create amazing 3D experiences and games.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero Networking Setup:</strong> No need to configure WebSockets or real-time sync.
        </li>
        <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Automatic state replication across all clients.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-Browser & Cross-Platform:</strong> Works on desktop, mobile, and VR
          headsets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimized for Performance:</strong> Uses
          <strong>WebGL, WebGPU, and Three.js</strong> for high-fidelity rendering, while keeping
          rendering agnostic so any renderer or major game engine can be used as a custom client.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No-Code & Low-Code Friendly:</strong> Start building with simple logic without
          deep programming knowledge.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Started Instantly</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need to be an expert in game development or networking to start. The 3D Web
        Experience and MML provide an easy-to-use framework that empowers creators to launch
        **multiplayer, interactive 3D experiences** in minutes.
      </p>
